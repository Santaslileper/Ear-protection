## Problem / motivation
<!-- What problem does this solve? E.g. "I can't limit Discord separately from my game" -->

## Proposed solution
<!-- What would you like to see? -->

## Windows API surface (if known)
<!-- If you know which Windows API would be involved, mention it here. 
     E.g. "IAudioSessionControl2 for per-app limits" -->

## Constraints
<!-- The project must remain a single .cs file with no external dependencies. 
     Does your proposal fit within that? -->

## Alternatives considered
<!-- Any other approaches you thought about? -->
